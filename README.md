`ngme` is an R package that contains functions for inference and prediction for Gaussian and non-Gaussian latent models. The package has support for linear mixed effects models, spatial random field models, and multivariate random fields. The package is no longer updated because it has been replaced by the more general `ngme2` package which can be found here:
