Description: Inference and prediction for linear mixed effects (random effects) models with 
    fixed effects, time-invariant random effects, time-varying random effects (defined as a 
    stochastic process), and error term. The latter three components can be specified as 
    Gaussian or non-Gaussian. One can drop the time-varying random effects term.
